## Features

- üñåÔ∏è Draw Rectangles, Circles, Text, Images and Paths
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimized for Performance (efficient rerendering & caching, OffscreenCanvas, Adaptive Frame-Rate)
- üîó Easy to use API with e.g. Width-Anchors (shapeA.width = shapeB.width)
- üôèüèΩ Framework agnostic (Works with React, Vue, Svelte & Co.)
- üñºÔ∏è Canvas- & SVG-Support
- üéÅ Many more little things that make developers happy

## Installation

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm add pinsel

# npm
npm i pinsel
```

_There is also the possibility to use only parts of Pinsel or to write extensions yourself. If you want to know more about this, have a look at the detailed documentation: `@pinsel/core` & `@pinsel/renderer`_

## Motivation
We were looking for a Libary to help us draw on the HTML5 Canvas, but to our surprise we couldn't find a suitable one. Known libaries either have a strong focus on artistic use (e.g. [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js?files=1)), or are mainly designed to visualise data (e.g. [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3)). Others are only documented in fragments, are inconvenient to use or simply lack features.

This is how we came up with the idea of writing a library ourselves, with which simple little gimmicks can be implemented. One that is easy to use and designed for TypeScript.

## Simple Usage
```typescript
// Creating Pinsel Instance
const p = new Pinsel({
  coordinateSpace: 'ADAPTIVE',
});

// Adding Rectangle
const rect = rectangle({ width: 0.5, height: 0.3, x: 0.1, y: 0 });
rect.stroke = 'pink';
p.scene.add(rect);

// Adding Circle
const circ = circle({
  radius: 0.1,
  x: 0.5,
  y: 0.5,
});
circ.stroke = 'green';
p.scene.add(circ);

// Adding Text
const text = label({
  text: 'PINSEL is the best!',
  x: 0.5,
  y: 0.5,
});
text.font = font(32, 'Fira Code');
p.scene.add(text);

```
